I started working at… Hey Mafiakitty, I got another job…. 20160913_190043, 20160929_214725

[2012-2013] [Close up of Mike’s boots and him tying then up, and at various jobs.] 
Each morning I wish something would happen. Maybe with luck, the trains will be delayed and I’ll be late again and get fired. How wonderful it would be if a car knicked me while crossing the road so I wouldn’t have to work this week [“beep” “beep” “beep” alarm going off]. At times I believe that I’d rather be homeless and able to wander the world than to be stuck doing this forever. 
[August 2014] Hey Mafiakitty, [footage of Tink], there must be another way. A way to live more frugally. A way to live with less stress, to own our home, to spend less time working for other people, and more time with you.

RVing would be fun and not very difficult to get into. But the cost of gas each day would be too much. We'd feel restricted being confined to parking lots and campgrounds. We want to be free like your friend Ernie. (link to doc).
When I was little at my grandfather's cabin, I dreamt about building a little wooden sailboat to go exploring, away from everything and everyone. [Footage of a one-sheet plywood boat]
A portable all-in-one off-the-grid apartment and vehicle. The ability to travel all over the world using the freely available wind. It would allow us to explore places that would have otherwise been inaccessible by cars, bikes, planes, or RVs. There’d be enough room for you and you’d finally know what it felt like to be free.
But sailboats for sale seem too expensive. Could we afford it? And the maintenance and the marina, too?

Maybe spending 8 hours a day cruising the oceans, working on the boat, foraging, fishing, and living off the grid instead of 8 hours a day working for someone else, might make us feel better. Being around people with similar goals and belonging to a community could be good for us.
But how do we learn how to sail, Mafiakitty? And where and how do you buy a sailboat?
